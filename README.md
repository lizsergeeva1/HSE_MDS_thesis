### **Salary prediction based on job description in the IT sector**


The project is focused on salary prediction based on job description within the IT sector in Russia using data collected from the HH.ru vacancies. The work involved reviewing various research papers and examining different model architectures. Experiments were conducted using several comparable models, including linear regression, random forest, Catboost, and Bi-GRU-CNN. The primary quality metrics used were MAE and R^2.
Following the experimentation phase, a Telegram Bot was developed. This bot responds to URL links and provides brief information about the job as well as the predicted salary.
